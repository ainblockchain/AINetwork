# Transactions

Transactions are signed messages that can mutate a global singleton tree-structured blockchain state which includes state for value, rule, and function. Another way to look at AIN transactions is that it is the way to deliver function parameters and the results as the value state triggers the function execution by AIN workers. Unlike block confirmation is needed to make sure transactions are valid, transactions in AI Network can be useful even when will be executed immediately on arrival in order to ensure constant liveliness and availability.
